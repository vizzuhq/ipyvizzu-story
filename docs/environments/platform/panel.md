## Sample

Try `ipyvizzu-story` in `Panel` with the following sample.

```python
# import ipyvizzu and ipyvizzu-story

from ipyvizzu import Data, Config
from ipyvizzustory import Slide, Step

from ipyvizzustory.env.pn.story import Story


# create data and initialize Story with the created data

data = Data()
data.add_series("Foo", ["Alice", "Bob", "Ted"])
data.add_series("Bar", [15, 32, 12])
data.add_series("Baz", [5, 3, 2])

# you can also add data with pandas

# import pandas as pd
#
# data = Data()
# df = pd.read_csv(
#     "https://ipyvizzu-story.vizzuhq.com/latest/assets/data/data.csv"
# )
# data.add_df(df)

story = Story(data=data)


# create Slides and Steps and add them to the Story

slide1 = Slide(
    Step(
        Config({"x": "Foo", "y": "Bar"}),
    )
)
story.add_slide(slide1)

slide2 = Slide(
    Step(
        Config({"color": "Foo", "x": "Baz", "geometry": "circle"}),
    )
)
story.add_slide(slide2)


# note: in Panel if you want to use the `play` method,
# you need to set the width and height in pixels

story.set_size(width="800px", height="480px")


# you can export the Story into a html file

story.export_to_html(filename="mystory.html")

# or you can get the html Story as a string

html = story.to_html()
print(html)


# you can display the Story with the `play` method

story.play()


# or you can customize Panel before `play`

# import panel as pn
#
# pn.extension(sizing_mode="stretch_width", template="fast")
#
# pn.state.template.param.update(
#     title="ipyvizzu-story",
# )
#
# story.play()


# or if you would like to customize it completely,
# you can do it with the `_repr_html_` method

# import panel as pn
#
# pn.extension(sizing_mode="stretch_width", template="fast")
#
# pn.state.template.param.update(
#     title="ipyvizzu-story",
# )
#
# pn.pane.HTML(
#     story,
#     height=500,
#     sizing_mode="stretch_both"
# ).servable()
```
