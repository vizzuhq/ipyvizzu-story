# ipyvizzu-story

## About The Extension

`ipyvizzu-story` is an extension of the animated charting tool
[ipyvizzu](https://github.com/vizzuhq/ipyvizzu) that enables users to create and
present interactive data presentations within the data science notebook of their
choice and to share them as an `HTML` file. The extension provides a widget that
contains the presentation and adds controls for navigating between slides -
predefined stages within the story being presented. Navigation also works with
keyboard shortcuts - arrow keys, `PgUp`, `PgDn`, `Home`, `End` - and you can
also use a clicker to switch between the slides.

## Installation

```sh
pip install ipyvizzu-story
```

Visit
[Installation chapter](https://ipyvizzu-story.vizzuhq.com/latest/installation)
for more options and details.

## Usage

You can check and download the code behind the animation on the top of the page
in our
[Example gallery](https://ipyvizzu-story.vizzuhq.com/latest/examples/usbudget/).

You can create the story below with the following code snippet.

from ipyvizzu import Data, Config
from ipyvizzustory import Story, Slide, Step

data = Data()
data.add_series("Foo", ["Alice", "Bob", "Ted"])
data.add_series("Bar", [15, 32, 12])
data.add_series("Baz", [5, 3, 2])

story = Story(data=data)

slide1 = Slide(
    Step(
        Config({"x": "Foo", "y": "Bar"}),
    )
)
story.add_slide(slide1)

slide2 = Slide(
    Step(
